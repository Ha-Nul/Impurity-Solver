## About Ha-Nul/Work
(last edited: 2024.03.06)
This Repository contains four folders,
*Retarded spin-spin interaction* folder for retarded spin-spin function code,
*Hamiltonian* folder for Hamiltonian for three-level charge qubit system,
*NCA* folder for NCA code written by c++. 
*OCA* folder for OCA code written by c++ language includes the header file(OCA_function_def.hpp)

The Retarded spin-spin function code and Hamiltonian code were saved as .py module so anyone who wants to use the code,
just clone the folder and import the .py file in their python code. </br>
